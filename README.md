# sqs-queue-parallel.js

sqs-queue-parallel is a **node.js** library build on top of **Amazon AWS SQS** with **concurrency and parallel** message poll support.

You can create a poll of SQS queue watchers, each one can receive 1 or more messages from Amazon SQS.

With sqs-queue-parallel you need just to configure your AWS private keys, setup your one o more `message` event callbacks and wait for new messages to be processed.



# Example

```javascript
var SqsQueueParallel = require('sqs-queue-parallel');

// Simple configuration:
//  - 2 concurrency listeners
//  - each listener can receive up to 4 messages
// With this configuration you could receive and parse 8 `message` events in parallel
var queue = new SqsQueueParallel({
	name: "sqs-test",
	maxNumberOfMessages: 4,
	concurrency: 2
});
queue.on('message', function (e)
{
	console.log('New message: ', e.metadata, e.data.MessageId)
	e.deleteMessage(function(err, data) {
	    e.next();
	});
});
queue.on('error', function (err)
{
	console.log('There was an error: ', err);
});
```


# Download

You can download and install this library using Node Package Manager (npm):

```bash
npm install sqs-queue-parallel --save
```

# Constructor


## new SqsQueueParallel(options = {})

First you need to initialize a new object instance with a configuration.

**Examples:**

Constructing an object
```javascript
var queue = new SqsQueueParallel({ name: 'sqs-test' });
```

**Options Hash (options):**

* **name** (String) — **_Required_**: name of the remote queue to be watched
* **region** (String) — the region to send/read service requests. Default is `process.env.AWS_REGION`
* **accessKeyId** (String) — your AWS access key ID. Default is `process.env.AWS_ACCESS_KEY`
* **secretAccessKey** (String) — your AWS secret access key. Default is `process.env.AWS_SECRET_KEY`
* **visibilityTimeout** (Integer) — duration (in seconds) that the received messages are hidden from subsequent retrieve requests after being retrieved by a ReceiveMessage request.
* **waitTimeSeconds** (Integer) — duration (in seconds) for which the call will wait for a message to arrive in the queue before returning. If a message is available, the call will return sooner than WaitTimeSeconds. Default is 20
* **maxNumberOfMessages** (Integer) — maximum number of messages to return. Amazon SQS never returns more messages than this value but may return fewer. Default is 1
* **concurrency** (Integer) — number of concurrency fetcher to start. Default is 1
* **debug** (Boolean) — enable debug mode. Default is false


**Important**:

Each `concurrency` queue can read `maxNumberOfMessages` messages from Amazon SQS.

For example, **2** `concurrency` queue with **5** `maxNumberOfMessages` can trigger a max of **5 * 2 = 10** `message` events; so it's very important to be carefull, expecially if you're working with I/O streams.



# Properties


## queue.client

Returns the SQS client object used by the queue.


## queue.url

Url of the connected queue.



# Methods


## queue.sendMessage(params = {}, callback)

Build on the top of `SQS.sendMessage()` allow you to easly push a message to the connected queue.

**Parameters:**

* **params** (Object)
	* body (Any type) — default to {}
	
		An arbitrary message, could be a string, a number or a object.
	* delay (Integer)
	
		The number of seconds (0 to 900 - 15 minutes) to delay a specific message. Messages with a positive DelaySeconds value become available for processing after the delay time is finished. If you don't specify a value, the default value for the queue applies

**Callback (callback):**

```javascript
function(err, data) {}
```

For more information take checkout the [official AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/SQS.html#sendMessage-property).

**Esample:**

```javascript
var SqsQueueParallel = require('src/sqs-queue-parallel');

var queue = new SqsQueueParallel({ name: "sqs-test" });
queue.sendMessage({
	body: 'my message',
	delay: 10
});
queue.sendMessage({
	body: [1, 2, 3]
}, function (err, data)
{
	if (err)
		console.log('There was a problem: ', err);
	else
		console.log('Item pushed', data);
});
```


## queue.changeMessageVisibility(receiptHandle, timeout, callback)

Build on the top of `SQS.changeMessageVisibility()` allow you to easly delay a message from the connected queue.

**Parameters:**

* **receipHandler** (String)

	The receipt handle associated with the message to delay.

* **timeout** (Integer)

	The new value (in seconds - from 0 to 43200 - maximum 12 hours) for the message's visibility timeout.

**Callback (callback):**

```javascript
function(err, data) {}
```

For more information take checkout the official [AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/SQS.html#changeMessageVisibility-property).

**Esample:**

```javascript
var SqsQueueParallel = require('src/sqs-queue-parallel');

var queue = new SqsQueueParallel({ name: "sqs-test" });
queue.changeMessageVisibility('receipt-handle-to-delay-1', 30);
queue.on('message', function (job)
{
	if (myTest is true)
		job.deleteMessage();
	else
		job.changeMessageVisibility(30);
	job.next();
});
```


## queue.deleteMessage(receiptHandle, callback)

Build on the top of `SQS.deleteMessage()` allow you to easly delete a message from the connected queue.

**Parameters:**

* **receipHandler** (String)

	The receipt handle associated with the message to delete.

**Callback (callback):**

```javascript
function(err, data) {}
```

For more information take checkout the official [AWS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSJavaScriptSDK/latest/AWS/SQS.html#deleteMessage-property).

**Example:**

```javascript
var SqsQueueParallel = require('src/sqs-queue-parallel');

var queue = new SqsQueueParallel({ name: "sqs-test" });
queue.deleteMessage('receipt-handle-to-delete-1');
queue.on('message', function (job)
{
	if (myTest is true)
		job.deleteMessage(function(err, data) {
		    job.next();
		});
});
```



# Events

## connect

```javascript
function(url) { }
